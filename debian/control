 Description
 ===========
 .
 Callsign is a DNS server for developers. It is intended to serve DNS only for a
 single machine - your desktop. It will support automated deployment systems
 that coordinate with DNS services, for example Yaybu.
 .
 Desktops vary in their client DNS configuration quite widely, and Callsign
 supports a number of different modes to enable it to service your DNS effectively.
 .
 The DNS service provides recursive queries, so you can continue to use DNS as usual.
